# Quantum
These are some basic self learning projects using available quantum computing software packages that I have undertaken to develop my understanding. They consist right now of

1) A quick quantum walk simultation I wrote awhile back using just Python and Numpy
2) A quick example of QAOA using Pennylane
3) A quick example of ZNE using global folds in Qiskit
